## Getting Started

### Automatic Installation
You create a new Next.js app using `create-next-app`, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest [directory-name]
```

After running the command, you'll see the following questions:
```bash
Would you like to use TypeScript? Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory? Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? No 
```

### Running Your Project

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. Now you have a Next.js app up and running. In the next section we'll dive into the project structure.
